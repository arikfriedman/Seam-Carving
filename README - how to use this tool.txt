INSTRUCTIONS:

this tool contains 3 different formats:

1)seam view - this format enables the user to view seam removals in both dimensions.

2)live size reduce - 1D - this format enables the user to resize the image in one specific dimension in real time.

3)resizing (enlarging inc.) - this format enables the user to resize (reduce or enlarge) the image in both dimensions.

FURTHER EXPLANATIONS:

1)seam view - 
the user is asked to provide 2 non-positive integers for the seam removal process. this format also comes along with a 
"energy insertion prevention", which adds the "forward energy" introduced in the later "Improved Seam Carving for Video Retargeting" paper.

2)live size reduce - 1D -
the user is asked to provide 1 non-positive integer (while the other one remains 0). after clicking the "RUN" button, the user
can now change the negative value to any value between 0 and 50% the size of the image in that specific dimension, followed
by a click on the "update" button. a real time change will appear in the figure.

3)resizing (enlarging inc.) -
the user is asked to provide 2 integers.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:

1)"save image" button - after running any format, clicking this button enables to user to save the updated image.

2)"restart" button

3)"region protection"/"region removal" - the user is given an option to draw regions in the image which he would like to
